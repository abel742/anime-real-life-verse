Real Life Verse — Replit-ready React app
=====================================

How to use (Replit)
1. Go to https://replit.com/~ and click **Create** → **Import from ZIP** (or create a new Repl and upload files).
2. Upload this ZIP file's contents to the Replit project.
3. After the files are in Replit, click the green **Run** button.
   - The dev server will start and open a preview. If it doesn't open automatically, open the preview URL.
4. That's it — your site title is **Real Life Verse** and the footer shows "Created by Somya".

Notes
- Tailwind utility classes are available using the Tailwind CDN included in public/index.html so no Tailwind build step is needed.
- Data (fan art, forum posts, etc.) is stored in the browser's localStorage.
- To deploy permanently later, connect this repo to Netlify or Vercel (I can help with that).

Enjoy!
